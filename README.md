A status bar for dwm.

Currently, it displays this system information:
* Network usage (download and upload)
* Disk usage
* Memory usage
* CPU usage (total and load)
* CPU temp
* Fan speed
* Brightness (screen and keyboard)
* System volume
* Battery usage/status
* WiFi status
* Time

... and this user information:
* TODO list updates
* Weather (current and forecasted)
* Backup logging
* Robinhood portfolio value

## Prerequisites ##
DWM StatusBar works best with Andrew Milkovich's [dualstatus patch](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/dualstatus/), which allows for displaying more information. If you choose not to use this patch in your setup, you will need to remove the semicolon separator that divides `top_bar` and `bottom_bar` in `format_string(Display *dpy, Window root)`.

All output is colored with the [colored status text](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscolors/) patch. If you do not want color or use a different color patch, you will need to update the source code for DWM StatusBar by modifying/removing the `COLOR*` macros in the print statements **AND** the `ERR` macro.

The weather JSONs from OpenWeatherMap.org are retrieved with [cURL](https://github.com/curl/curl), specifically libcurl. You can find installation instructions on their GitHub page or [website](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/). Yes, the URL looks sketchy, but it's legit.

Those JSONs are then parsed with Dave Gamble's lightweight [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON). You will need to install the headers and libraries to /usr/include/cJSON and /usr/lib (respectively) for the default installation or tell the compiler where to look for them in the Makefile. You can find more detailed instructions on the GitHub page.

Other standard linux libraries used that you should have by default:
* asound
* procps
* netlink
* libnl
* math (m)


## Installation ##
To download through GitHub:
* `git clone https://github.com/snhilde/dwm-statusbar`

Otherwise:
* download the zip
* open the archive with `unzip path/to/file.zip`

You will most likely have to work through the [Getting Started](#getting-started) and [Macros](#macros) sections for the compilation to go smoothly.

Just run `make` to build the executable. There is no install function in the Makefile. It is my belief that you will put the executable wherever you want to and are legally allowed. I keep it in my home folder's bin, so my personal Makefile includes this line:
```
all:
	@cp -f dwm-statusbar /home/user/bin/
```

## Usage ##
If you run the program directly, keep in mind that everything runs inside of a loop, making the program non-terminating (except for certain errors).

To run DWM StatusBar from the command line, type this:
```
/path/to/dwm-statusbar
```
To run it without specifying the path, you will need to place the bin in a folder in your terminal's path. You can add a directory to the path variable with a line in your shell's start-up script like this:
```
export PATH=/path/to/statusbar/directory/:$PATH
```
To start the program when X11 starts up (and you know you want to), add this line to your .xinitrc before the call for dwm:
```
/path/to/dwm-statusbar 2> /home/user/.logs/dwm-statusbar.log &
```
This will start the program, log the errors to dwm-statusbar.log, and not block the queue during startup.

If you are having troubles getting DWM StatusBar to run correctly, check out the [Macros](#macros) section first.

## Getting Started ##
To choose which parts of the program you want displayed on your setup, edit config.h, placing your selections in each bar according to the order that you want them displayed.

Because DWM StatusBar is designed to parse information thoroughly and with as little overhead as possible, there are some things that you will need to set up on your end to get the program running correctly. If you don't want to set up everything as instructed below, you should modify the source code to reflect your preferences.

For example, if you don't want to display the status of your backups, you should remove `"backup"` from config.h. This will remove functionality. To change functionality, you will need to get your hands dirty and edit the source code directly.

Here are the major points of configuration:
#### TODO file ####
DWM StatusBar looks for a TODO file formatted like this:
```
Project Heading
	Current task
		subtask1
		subtask2
	Next task
	
Another Project
	Current task
```
... and so on. DWM StatusBar parses this file like so:
1. If there is nothing in the file, then congratulations, you have your life together. Nothing is printed.
2. Otherwise, the first project's heading is always printed.
3. If there is a task, it is concatenated and printed with a separating "->".
4. If there is a subtask, it is also concatenated and printed with a separating "->".
5. If there are no tasks but there is another project, it is printed with a separating "|".
6. No more than three lines are ever concatenated and printed (max one task and one subtask).

#### Log status ####
I keep my error logs for dwm and DWM StatusBar in a `.logs` directory in my home folder. This part of the program checks if there are errors in either log file and displays a message to check the log(s) if there are. To quiet the message, run `echo > /path/to/logfile` to reset the log.

#### Weather (current and forecast) ####
I might get rid of this section soon. I made it more for a learning opportunity than to get much-needed value. Let's be real; we all use our phones to check the weather. This function gets weather data for your location and outputs the current temp and highs/lows for the rest of the day and the next three days. If there is a forecast for rain, the day gets highlighted. There is no functionality yet for other major weather patterns. Sorry, Russia.

To get data for your location, you will need to find your city's ID [here](https://openweathermap.org/appid). While you're there, also study up on getting your own free API key. You're not using mine. Your city ID will go in the header for the macro `LOCATION`, and the API key will go in the macro `KEY`.

#### Backup status ####
This one is a whole other beast. I won't feel bad at all if you decide to leave it out (by modifying config.h).

If you do leave it in, you will need to customize the function heavily. My script creates a backup, encrypts it, and uploads it to a server, and prints each of those steps into a log file. This function parses that file for those strings or error codes like this:
1. If the contents of the file are digits, then it parses the number for an error code in `parse_error_code(int code)`. That code is converted into an error message and printed to the bar.
2. If the contents of the file are digits but not an error code, then it must be the time in seconds since the epoch when the backup was completed. This number is calculated against the current time to get the time elapsed and printed accordingly.
3. If the contents of the file are not digits, then the string is printed straight to the bar.

To customize this function, you will want to update the error codes of your backup script, chiefly.

## Macros ##
If things are not working well, this should be the first place you visit.

Because computers differ, there are a few things that you must configure before running DWM StatusBar. All values and options are contained in the header file. Let's walk through them:
- - - -
```
#define COLOR_NORMAL			color1
#define COLOR_ACTIVE			color2
#define COLOR1				color3
#define COLOR2				color4
#define COLOR_WARNING			color5
#define COLOR_ERROR			color6
#define GREEN_TEXT			color7
#define RED_TEXT				color8
#define COLOR_HEADING			COLOR_ACTIVE

const char color1 = '';
const char color2 = '';
const char color3 = '';
const char color4 = '';
const char color5 = '';
const char color6 = '';
const char color7 = '';
const char color8 = '';
```
These colors correspond to the colors that you defined in your config.h for DWM. Make any changes you think are pretty.

```
#define SCREEN_BRIGHTNESS_FILE		"/sys/class/backlight/nvidia_backlight/brightness"
```
This will change depending on the video driver you use
- - - -
```
#define KBD_BRIGHTNESS_FILE		"/sys/class/leds/smc::kbd_backlight/brightness"
```
If you don't have a keyboard backlight, just delete this line.
- - - -
```
#define BATT_STATUS_FILE			"/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/status"
```
The system file that holds battery status in text format, like "Full" or "Charging"
- - - -
```

```
The system file that holds the percentage of battery left
- - - -
```
#define WIFI_INTERFACE			"wlp4s0"
```
The name of your wireless device. You can find it by running `iw dev` or `ip link`.

## Testing ##
Testing individual functions is very easy, especially in dwm.

To limit the program to one or more specific functions, just comment out or delete functions from config.h. Please share the results of your tests with the community to better the project.

#### Valgrind ####
This is the reference command for running the *memcheck* program in valgrind:
```
valgrind -v --leak-check=yes --undef-value-errors=no --log-file=valgrind.log ./dwm-statusbar
```
After fixing various memory leaks (thanks, valgrind), I have been unable to completely seal the program due to the X11 library, specifically from `XCreateFontSet`, which is throwing memory leak problems in two different areas:
1. An unpaired `malloc` for 18 bytes in 1 block
2. An unpaired `realloc` for 192 bytes in 1 block following this trail:
XCreateFontSet (in /usr/lib/libX11.so.6.3.0)
	-> XOpenOM (in /usr/lib/libX11.so.6.3.0)
		-> _XOpenLC (in /usr/lib/libX11.so.6.3.0)
			-> _XlcDefaultLoader (in /usr/lib/libX11.so.6.3.0)
				-> _XlcCreateLC (in /usr/lib/libX11.so.6.3.0)
				
I have been unable to figure out how to fix this leak so far. Because `XCreateFontSet` gets called just one time (in the initialization), there is a total leak of only 200 bytes during the entire life of the program. That's not bad, so I'm leaving it as is for now until a rainy day.

## Future Additions ##
* Currently, the program only handles WiFi connectivity. Let's add other connections as well.
* Fork certain functions (like `get_weather()`) into a separate thread.

## Contributing ##
Send a pull request or a message. Additional functionality is welcome, as are suggestions to make the program leaner, faster, and better performing.
